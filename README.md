Accuracy metrics are used to train, test, and examine the models and offer deep insights into how they function. even though the decision tree model has the highest accuracy, similarly, examination of the precision, recall, and F1-scores indicates capacity improvement areas. This assignment gives a complete analysis of artificial intelligence (also called AI) techniques appropriate for direct marketing scenarios for you to assist practitioners in optimizing campaign costs and improving decision-making processes.
